# param.waybackurls

This tool extracts all parameters from URLs generated by the waybackurls utility and checks for open redirection vulnerabilities across all found parameters. It's designed to help identify potential security weaknesses efficiently.

*Features:*

Parameter Extraction: Automatically retrieves all parameters from archived URLs provided by waybackurls.
Open Redirection Testing: Scans each extracted parameter to identify possible open redirection vulnerabilities, outputting any affected URLs.
Optimized Workflow: Works best when paired with waybackurls for gathering URL data from Wayback Machine archives.
 
 *Usage:*

Make the script executable:

---->   chmod +x param.way.B.urls
 
 Run the script with a file of URLs:

---->  ./param.way.B.urls urls.txt

*Output:*

Vulnerable URLs: The script outputs URLs that are vulnerable to open redirection.
Parameter List: A parameter.txt file containing all the extracted parameters for further analysis.
